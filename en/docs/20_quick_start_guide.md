Install BroodMinder-T and -TH in the middle frame (usually n°5) starting from the left side seen from the rear of the hive. T2 shall be over the brood box and TH over the super.

Place your BroodMinder-W scale at the rear side of the hive. Make sure that the hive is leveled as well as possible.

### ![image](./20_quick_start_guide.assets/icons/30px/007.png) 7. Update start date/time

To avoid having measurements from outside the hive, change the start date of the sensors.
To do so, go to `BeesApp > Apiaries > unfold the hives to see the sensors > "..." > Change the current position`. 
Edit the `start date/time`.
