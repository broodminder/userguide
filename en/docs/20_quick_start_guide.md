## Note the following best practices:

A. Use our video library

- Watch the video help "[Quick Start with CS Kit](https://youtu.be/6WicH4_l2FQ)"

B. Tag your hives

- 1, 2, 3, A, B, C, *, # : do what it takes to identify your hives, it will be much better.

C. Prepare everything AT HOME

- Make sure the system is functional before installing it in the apiary, then it will be less easy to set up.

![activateDevices](./20_quick_start_guide.assets/activateDevices600.png)

!!! warning "Take care of this:"
    Do not discard any plastic part. Keep them all in place.
    
    Check that all seals are properly installed.
    
    Verify that cable glands are tight too when appropriate.



### ![image](./20_quick_start_guide.assets/icons/30px/004.png) 4. Assign devices to hives
Attach every device to one hive. All happens into the 3dots `...` menus 

- A devices will appear in the `Devices` tab

- B In the `Apiary` tab you can create apiaries and hives

- C and then assign devices to hives

![assignDevices](./20_quick_start_guide.assets/assignDevices600.png)




### ![image](./20_quick_start_guide.assets/icons/30px/005.png) 5. Make your first sync

Using BroodMinder Bees App there are multiple ways of syncing: 

- `Multi-Sync` is at the top of the screen in the `Apiaries` tab. This syncs all devices at once and is a Premium feature.
- `Single Sync`is within the 3dots `...`menus, either in `Devices`or in `Apiaries` tab

!!! Tip
    You can only sync devices appearing in green (within bluetooth range)

![firstSync](./20_quick_start_guide.assets/firstSyncA.png)

Now look to your data using `... > Show Graph` or `... > Show Details`.

!!! info
    On your first sync you probably do not see much data since there is only one or two samples.

## 🐝 NOW MOVE TO THE APIARY

### ![image](./20_quick_start_guide.assets/icons/30px/006.png) 6. Install devices in hives

Install BroodMinder-T and -TH in the middle frame (usually n°5) starting from the left side seen from the rear of the hive. T2 shall be over the brood box and TH over the super.

Place your BroodMinder-W scale at the rear side of the hive. Make sure that the hive is leveled as well as possible. 

![Install devices](./20_quick_start_guide.assets/installDevicesInHive.png)

### ![image](./20_quick_start_guide.assets/icons/30px/007.png) 7. Update start date/time

To avoid having measurements from outside the hive, change the start date of the sensors.
To do so, go to `BeesApp > Apiaries > unfold the hives to see the sensors > "..." > Change the current position`. 
Edit the `start date/time`.

### ![image](./20_quick_start_guide.assets/icons/30px/008.png) 8. Explore and discover

Now you can also go to MyBroodMinder.com and explore your data.
