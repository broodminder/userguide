# Citizen Science 

Broodminder & Mellisphera are collaborating with [Beecounted.org](https://beecounted.org). Our applications open up the possibility of sharing data with this international initiative. 

Beecounted.org collects information from hundreds of beekeepers _Citizen Scientists_ who share data from their hives with the community. 
This data is publicly accessible and helps researchers and scientists improve knowledge about bees.

Beecounted is also the way to go around the world of beehives. How are the colonies in Canada doing these days? Check it out!
