## MyBroodMinder.com Cloud Storage

The true power of the BroodMinder movement is in the data from thousands of hives stored for public consumption at MyBroodMinder.com.

We have done our best to make it as simple as possible for you to transfer the data there. **From the BroodMinder App, you only need to push the Sync button and answer a few questions.** The app will create a new MyBroodMinder account for you and everything needed to get going.After that the data will be transferred. _You do not need to create a MyBroodMinder account before pushing data._

Once the data is on MyBroodMinder.com you can see it and combine the data from the sensors into one easy to read graph for each hive.

With any web browser, go to MyBroodMinder.com. You will need to enter the same username (e-mail) and password. After that you will see a menu similar to the image below.

## Setting-up your apiary

The creation and edition of hives is done from the _Configuration_ menu, as you can see in the picture below. However, some common functions are also available in the contextual menus associated with apiaries and hives (see below).

### Move device 

In the hive menu (above), you can also move the sensor (to another hive for example). 

### Move hive 

It is possible to move a hive from one apiary to another. This changes its location and also adapts the weather to the new location. This function is accessible from the contextual menu and also from the _Configure_ menu, then _Apiaries_, then in the table the column _History Apiaries_ which enables you to define the location sequence.

### Dead hive

Dead or missing hives can be deactivated so that they are no longer visible in the apiary. Their data nevertheless remain accessible and can be used later. 

Please note that this action is IRREVERSIBLE.
