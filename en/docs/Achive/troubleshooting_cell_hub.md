# Troubleshooting Cell Hub models 44, 46 and 50

NOTE : this procedure applies only to the "old" hubs models 44, 46 and 50.

Those hubs are not available trough the Broodminder Bees app. **You will need to install Broodminder Cell App** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.broodminder.cell&hl=en_US&gl=US), [iOs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.broodminder.cell&hl=en_US&gl=US) to manage the settings

## Install SIM
Here are the steps to install SIM

1. unplug the 3G Card
2. open the shield : slide it up through the antenna with the thumb then pull up to leave it
3. introduce SIM in the right position

4. pull down and slide down to lock

## Typical startup
Switch on the hub,
you should see :
At startup after switching on you should see

- Led D1 (orange) blinking several times
- Led PWR1 (green) on
- Led STAT (yellow) on
- then after a while, when it has established connectionto the network => all leds off

Note that for every time youâ€™ll go with the Cell app to `Configure > Diagnostics > Cell network` you should see the PWR1 green led lighting on

## Cell network connection
It can happen that your hub finds out 3G network but it is not able to acquire cervice.

To find out what is wrong first of all check your APN code

### Check you have the right APN
Every SIM provider has its own APN (Access Point Name) it can be *hologram*, *matooma.m2m*, etc...
Go to `Configure > Diagnostics > Cell network > Custom APN`

### Check modem communication and trace
Just after switching on the hub, go quick to `Configure > Diagnostics > Modem communication` There you can follow the connection process. Let it run until it stops and then copy this output and send it to support

This is a typical startup trace :
