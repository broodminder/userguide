## Installing your BroodMinder

The Citizen Science Package contains two Broodminder-TH (temperature and humidity) or T2 (temperature only) Devices and a Broodminder-W hive scale. Here is where you install these devices:

## Routine Maintenance

There is not much routine maintenance that is required. Please note that if your batteries are lasting less than 6 months, something is wrong and you should contact [Support@Broodminder.com](mailto:Support@Broodminder.com) for replacement or refurbishment.

### Spring

We have a video talking about spring maintenance on the support page at 
<a href="https://mybroodminder.com/app/resources" target="_blank">mybroodminder.com/resources</a>.
In the spring, it is a good time to clean up your devices. You can use 91% or better Isopropyl or Ethyl Alcohol, it will not harm the electronics.

You can place the wrappers in the freezer and then propolis will break off more easily.

**Ensure that the scale wrapper is not cracked, that will allow rain to harm the sensors.** You can seal any cracks with packing tape.

We also have replacem ent wrappers for all the devices on our website at Broodminder.com.

We also offer Refresh service where we replace the housings and batteries and test the devices. This is a very good option every couple of years to ensure that your devices are operating properly. There is more information at <a

### Fall

Prior to winter, replace all of the batteries in your BroodMinders. (A good place to buy them is Amazon.com or Digikey.com. You can get them for less than $0.50 each). 

**Ensure that the scale wrapper is not cracked, that will allow rain to harm the sensors.** You can seal any cracks with packing tape or order replacement wrappers at Broodminder.com.


## Device Firmware Updates

All BroodMinder devices have provision for Over-The-Air (OTA) upgrades. These are performed by the Bees app. For more information, go to this link.
