# Winter Service check-list

For peace of mind and greater efficiency, we recommend servicing all of your devices at the end of each season. 
Starting the next season with empty memory devices, loaded bateries and updated firmwares will put all the chances on your side.


## Prepare hardware


- [ ] Order some CR2032 batteries to have enough stock

!!! note 
    Forget your supermarket and low cost sites where you won't have any quality guarantee. Order a batch of batteries in dedicated shops to get a fair price (about 0,50â‚¬).

- [ ] Collect all your devices and bring them at home, you want to work comfortable
- [ ] make a full sync of all your devices with the Apiary App to catch any sample that the hub eventually missed  (leave your phone syncing and charging and go for a coffee or two)
