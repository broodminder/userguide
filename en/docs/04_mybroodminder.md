## MyBroodMinder.com Cloud Storage

The true power of the BroodMinder movement is in the data from thousands of hives stored for public consumption at MyBroodMinder.com.

We have done our best to make it as simple as possible for you to transfer the data there. **From the BroodMinder App, you only need to push the Sync button and answer a few questions.** The app will create a new MyBroodMinder account for you and everything needed to get going.After that the data will be transferred. _You do not need to create a MyBroodMinder account before pushing data._

Once the data is on MyBroodMinder.com you can see it and combine the data from the sensors into one easy to read graph for each hive.

With any web browser, go to MyBroodMinder.com. You will need to enter the same username (e-mail) and password. After that you will see a menu similar to the image below.

### Moving a sensor 

In the hive menu (above), you can also move the sensor (to another hive for example).

It is possible to move a hive from one apiary to another. This changes its location and also adapts the weather to the new location.
