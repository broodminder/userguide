In this section, we will deal with more technical aspects of Mellisphera's operation. We will present you our different models: BFIT, BFORCE, BWEIGHT as well as the METEO sources and ALERTS.

## Introduction to Precision beekeeping

Mellisphera is essentially a system for analyzing hive health. Our goal is to make the best use of all available data to simply give the right information at the right time to beekeepers. Beekeepers are therefore informed in real time of every event occurring in their apiaries. Events that are occurring at the moment, but also events to come. In this way, they can plan their inspections in advance knowing what to expect. The diagnosis is made before going to the apiary, the inspection completes it.
