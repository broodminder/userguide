## Sensors & software

### What are the different BroodMinder apps ?

The BroodMinder app (also called BroodMinder Lite) is the basic free application. With this app, you can visualize your sensors, send your data by e-mail, see different graphs, annotate your inspections, etc.

BroodMinder Apiary is a more powerful app. It makes it possible to download data from all your BroodMinder sensors in a single step. This is an efficient time-saver for users that have many sensors. The app is free but requires a subscription for productivity features.

BroodMinder Cell is the app for controlling Hubs.

### Retrieving data from sensors

#### Do the sensors record the measurements?

Each sensor has an internal memory. Every hour they measure data and store it in their memory. The storage capacity is about one year of measurements. We often see sensors with more than 7000 readings! (365*24=8760 readings/year). This memory can be emptied either by removing the battery for a few seconds or from the mobile application. Of course before doing this, make sure that you have synchronized the data with mybroodminder! 

#### How do I recover data with a smartphone? 

You must go to your apiary with a smartphone that has one of the BroodMinder apps (Lite or Apiary). If you have a free account, the synchronization will be done sensor by sensor. All sensors communicate via Bluetooth. The smartphone's coverage distance is a few meters.

#### How does data recovery from a Hub work?

The Hub provides you with real-time monitoring. You have access to all alerts and can anticipate your work on the apiary before you even get there. The Hub is available in two versions - Wifi & GSM -  depending on your connectivity. This transmitter must be placed in the center of your apiary. It will collect and transmit data automatically, whether you have a single or dozens of sensors within a radius of about 20 meters. 

#### What can I do if I can't synchronize my hives ?

The Bluetooth coverage distance depends on many factors. On some hives, this coverage can be limited. Position yourself as close as possible to the hive and try again following the instructions. If another failure occurs, contact us at support@mellisphera.com. 

### Battery 

#### Is the battery replaceable?

Yes, all batteries are button type CR203 and can be found in any large store.

#### How long does the battery last?

Under normal conditions, the battery lasts more than a year. We recommended you to replace it during the autumn harvest. We will notify you when it is time to replace it.

#### Do BroodMinder sensors last more than a year?

Don't worry as long as the battery is replaced. The sensors will last for many years.

### Account Settings

#### Where can I change the language, date format, units & weather source?

You have access to all your account settings in the top right corner of the Mellisphera app. 

![Account settings](./images/settings_app.png)

You can change as you wish the unit system (metric or imperial), the date format and the language (French, Spanish and English available for the moment). You can also choose your weather source. Depending on your preference and your feedback, you will have the possibility to choose your favourite source.

## Data

### I don't have any data when I log in, why ? 

Your data is loaded each time you log in. At your first connection, the process may be long if you have many sensors. Be patient, it can take up to ten minutes at your very first connection.

### Moving a sensor or a hive

#### How do I move my sensor to another hive or my hive to another apiary ?

In case you would like to move your sensor or your hive, you must go to MyBroodMinder.com to complete your change. In the 'Configure' section, click on 'Location History' for the involved sensor or on 'Apiary History' for the concerned hive. 

On these sections, you have an overview of your sensor and hive locations. You can also modify/add a new location for your sensor or your hive. Don't forget to specify the start and end dates for all locations. The data are assigned to the hive only from the date/time indicated.

You will see these changes in Mellisphera the next time you log in. Your data history will be kept on the previous hive and you will see the new data arriving on the hive mentioned in the new location. 

#### One of my hive is dead. Can I declare it dead and no longer see it in the app?

Yes! Simply go to MyBroodMinder.com in the 'Configure' section. In the 'Hives' menu, you can 'deactivate' the dead hive. When you log back in to Mellisphera, you will no longer see it. However, your data will remain and you will still find it.

Please note that this action is irreversible. You won't have the possibility to reactivate this hive, but it is possible to create a new one with the same name.

#### What can I do if my moon & weather calendars are empty? 

If your calendars are empty, please check if you filled in the 'Postal Code' and 'Country Code' fields when you created your apiary. If you want to check it, go to MyBroodMinder > Configure > Apiaries. 

In order to collect moon and weather data, we need to know a bit about your apiary location. If your settings are correct, your calendars should look like this:

#### My weather calendar indicates that it rained a lot yesterday, but it didn't. Why ?

![Rainfall](./images/pluie_mm.png#thumbnail)

Weather services are based on models and locations that are not always accurate. In some cases, your data may be slightly different from reality. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can change your weather source in the Mellisphera account settings (see above in the settings section).

#### My hive lost a lot of weight yesterday due to the removal of a supper but I can't see it in the weight chart. Why ? 

The "weight" chart displays the daily productivity of your connected hives. We calculate every day your hive weight - the consumption of your bees. This means that we do not take into account your operations (nourishment, supper removal or addition, etc.) or excessive weight variations due to swarming for example.

#### I get several weight measurements every day, I don't understand what they mean.

This means that you have several scales assigned to your hive. Please check your sensor assignments on MyBroodMinder.com. If this is on purpose, you can check or uncheck (on top of the calendar) the sensor you want to display. All weight sensors are displayed by defaults.

#### Why do I have white stickers on my apiary picture?
