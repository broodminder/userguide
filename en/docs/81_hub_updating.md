# BroodMinder Hub Firmware Update

## Overview

From time to time we make updates to improve the operation of our sensors. BroodMinder devices use OTA (Over The Air) firmware updates and are very simple to perform. 


## Updating BroodMinder-T91 Cell hub

- Check current hub firmware installed with Bees App (see below)
- Trigger the upgrade (see below)
    - Cycle power
    - When the hub restarts it will go through a green then a blue light for 5 sec
    - During that blue light, press the central button to trigger the upgrade
    - Wait and watch for 2-3 minutes. 
    - The hub will reboot automatically
- Verify with Bees App that the firmware has upgraded

You're done.

Once complete, you should see the updated firmware version in the Hub details page (as you made it before)
