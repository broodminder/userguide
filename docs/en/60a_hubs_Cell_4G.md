The BroodMinder-T91 (BRM-54) Cell Hub is based on the Nordic "Thingy 91".

!!! tip "Important: Real-Time Data Requires a Premium Membership"  
    Real-time data streaming through a hub is a Premium feature in MyBroodMinder. To enable it, you must have an active Premium subscription.

    Since the new membership model launched in January 2025, a single Premium membership allows you to use as many hubs as needed. Subscriptions are no longer linked to individual hubs—you only need one subscription per account, regardless of how many hubs you operate.

    **Note:** When you receive a hub, it is not yet linked to your account. You’ll need to claim it manually, just like any other BroodMinder device.

## Steps to get your hub up and running

- We recommend you **test everything before taking it to your apiary**.

- Turn on the hub using the slide switch.

   ![T91](../assets/60_hubs.assets/image-20230408082210955.png#mediumImg)

- In the Bees App, go to the `Devices` tab and, like every other sensor, claim your hub. This will assign it to your account.

   ![claim hub](../assets/60_hubs.assets/claim_hub.jpg#largeImg)

- Enter the `... > Show details` menu.

- Here you can check some key elements of your hub such as the firmware version, network signal and quality metrics, and selected carrier.  
- At the bottom of the screen, there is a black console box displaying the current status of the hub (you must be close to the hub with your smartphone—this data is sent via Bluetooth). You can watch it boot and connect to the cloud. Most of the time, its normal status will be `tick` or `tock`, indicating smooth operation.

!!! tip
    If the hub fails to reach the network, a timeout will appear after a few attempts and the LED will begin blinking red.

- If you have a **solar T91**, ensure that the gasket is seated correctly when replacing the lid. Also, make sure the solar panel is facing the sun for most of the day.

- If you have a **naked T91**, it must be placed in a weatherproof housing. We recommend the **Lacrosse Solar Shield**, and placing the T91 in the provided **mesh bag** to prevent small insects (such as earwigs) from entering.

- Once you see it working properly, move it to your apiary. When in place, check the `tick/tock` status again to confirm proper operation and network quality at that location.

## Assigning the hub to an apiary

By default, hubs are automatically assigned to the apiary of the devices they are transmitting data for.  
For example, if a scale is assigned to Hive 1 in Apiary 1, and the hub is sending data for that scale, it will automatically assign itself to Apiary 1.  

⚠️ It will **not** reassign itself again if moved — manual reassignment is required in MyBroodMinder.

- Go to [MyBroodMinder.com](https://mybroodminder.com), choose `Configure`, and expand the `Hubs` section.
- Click on the `Edit` icon to assign or move the hub to an apiary.

## Extended range

If you are experiencing poor cell network coverage, an external antenna may improve the situation.

We may have several solutions for your location — contact us at **support@broodminder.com**.

One example is this **External Antenna Kit**.  
The antenna plugs into the connector marked **“LTE”** on the Thingy91.

![Antenna connector](../assets/60_hubs.assets/image-20230408084030343.png)

1. Place the connector through the plastic mounting bracket.  
2. Push the connector into the Thingy91’s LTE jack.  
3. Secure the bracket using the included screw.
