# W3 and DIY circuit board calibration

What follow will explain you how to calibrate the hive scales BroodMinder-W3 model or for the BroodMinder-DIY


### Calibration (DIY and W3UA Only)

You will now calibrate your scale using the Bees App.

Watch the video to get you started :

The excel sheet for calibration is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yNMxpkNxwFt1J_uJ8xHo6vfJbq1KBUc7IOpyQM6JVI4/edit).
You will need to make a copy in your own drive (`File > make a copy`)


You will find the calibration screen in the Bees App at ` Devices Tab > [Device name] > ... > Show details > ... > Troubleshooting > Calibrate Scale`

Your objective is to find the actual four Divisors. A good divisor starting point is :

- 32000 for 50kg load cells
- -17000 for 100kg load cells (note the negative divisor)
- -9000 for 200kg load cells (note the negative divisor)

!!! tip
    You do not need to take care of Offsets. They are automatically computed on Tare.

    Basically what is happening here is we are using linear algebra to solve the simultaneous equations generated by the first 5 positions. After zeroing the sensors, there 4 weights and 4 variables (slopes). Through the magic of mathematics, we get the answers.
