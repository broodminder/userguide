![image](../assets/88_winter_service/sync.jpg){ style="display: block; margin: 0 auto" }


To ensure peace of mind and greater efficiency, we recommend servicing all of your devices at the **end of each season**. Starting the next season with devices that have **empty memory, fresh batteries, and updated firmware** will give you the best chance for success.  

If you’d prefer us to handle this for you, visit [BroodMinder-Refresh](https://broodminder.com/products/refresh-broodminder-t2) at BroodMinder.com. We’ll clean, test, replace batteries and housings. If a device fails testing, we’ll contact you and offer a **refurbished unit at 50% of the cost of a new device**.

!!! tip "General Tips for Device Maintenance"  
    - Use **91% or higher Isopropyl or Ethyl Alcohol** to clean circuits without damaging electronics.  
    - Place wrappers in the freezer to make propolis removal easier.  
    - Find replacement wrappers for all devices on our [e-Store](https://broodminder.com).  
    - Check wrappers for cracks and seal any small cracks with **packing tape**.  
    - Watch our maintenance video in the [Video Library](https://doc.mybroodminder.com/86_video_library/).

## Prepare the Hardware  

- [ ] **Order CR2032 batteries** to ensure you have enough stock.  

!!! note  
    Avoid cheap batteries from supermarkets or low-cost sites. Purchase from reputable shops to guarantee quality.  
    For example, check [Farnell](https://fr.farnell.com/renata/cr-2032-mfr-1bl/pile-bouton-3v/dp/1823479?st=cr2032) for fair pricing (~€0.50).  

- [ ] **Gather all your devices** and bring them home for servicing in a comfortable environment.  
- [ ] Perform a **full sync** of all devices using the Bees App (`Manage Tab > Sync`) to ensure no data is missed.  
    - Leave your phone syncing while charging and enjoy a coffee (or two).

- Clean the scale to remove dirt.  
- Inspect and clean **box sealings**.  
- Check the wrappers, cable gland nuts, and box screws for damage.

### 4G Cell Hub 
(Model 54)

!!! tip "FOTA Upgrade Tips"  
    - We’re preparing **firmware version 3.4x** (Dec. 2024).  
    - Updates are done via **Firmware Over The Air (FOTA)**, not through your phone.  
    - If you have version **1.x or 2.x**, send the hub to us for a factory upgrade.  

**Triggering FOTA Upgrade**  
1. Cycle the hub power.  
2. Upon restart, observe the **green light** followed by a **blue light**.  
3. During the **blue light** phase (5 sec), press the central button to trigger the update.  
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for the hub to reboot.  
5. Verify the firmware update using the Bees App.
