Multiscale-1 is a multi hive scale that uses single load cells for each hive. The classical setup is a 4-hive stand with combined with 4x200kg loadcells and a single XLR board.

Above is an example build on a hive stand is available from [BetterBee](https://www.betterbee.com/wooden-hive-equipment-10-frame/LYHE4033.asp)

Another similar set-up consisting on a 3 hive slots with single 200kg loadcell and plywood plate is described in the pictures below

| Model         | Pros               | Cons  |
|---------------|--------------------|------------|
| **Multiscale1** | Most accurate architecture, a single load cell is individually calibrated on a dedicated circuit board channel. | It rocks and it rolls. Having a single path to transfer all the stresses, results in an architecture that is not extremely stable. Once you touch the hive, it all starts to roll. <br>Some bees do not like it and get agressive. |
