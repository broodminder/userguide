There are many great features available in MyBroodMinder to view and analyze your data. Please note that there is a lot of context help by either hovering your cursor over an item or clicking the `?` next to an item.

We have updated the [video library](https://myBroodMinder.com/app/resources) for Version 5. 

The quick tour is pretty long. There are a lot of useful features. Let's start by describing the functions available to you. 

The best way to learn is to read this guide while looking at your MyBroodMinder account.

Note that some features are for MyBroodMinder premium users. The feature breakdown is [here](https://myBroodMinder.com/app/premium-subscription). We discuss more about Free and Premium at the end of this chapter.

## Left Sidebar - Choose which hives to view

The left sidebar is your key to navigating your apiaries and hives as well as apiaries shared with you by your friends. There is a lot of functionality built into this menu. Explore by clicking around.

- Clicking on `>` opens up hives in the apiary and devices in the hives

- When you click on an Apiary, it will display the hives in the apiary and bring up the data in the main window. Click it a second time and it removes the data from the view.
- Clicking a second apiary will add the hives to the view. Notice that the hives which are displayed are underlined. The color of the underline is the color of the graph line for that hive.
- Clicking a hive will toggle it to display or not display.
- The small `X` to the right of `Multi-Select` will clear all of the hive displays.

## Dashboard - Choose how to display the data

The buttons at the top of the view window let you chose how to display your information. We provide some standard views that we believe are useful. You can also add custom view to include many new analysis features.

You can choose a fixed timeframe to share, or a variable timeframe such as the last 2 weeks. When you share it this way, it will always bring up the newest 2 weeks of data. You can also add a description which will display at the top of the graph.
  - Download - You can download the BroodMinder data, the weather data, and/or the notes to a CSV (Comma Separated Variable) file.

### Graph Controls

There are powerful new note capabilities in both MyBroodMinder and the Bees app. You can use the Bees app to add notes in the field, and then edit or add additional notes when you review them in MyBroodMinder.

![image-20230407161925154](../assets/50_mybroodminder_v5.assets/image-20230407161925154.png#mediumImg)

The most simple way to add a note is to double click on a graph at the time you want to add a note. An editor will pop up. You can enter text and you can also add tags. Once you save the note it will show up on the graph as a hive tool. 

You can also add a note for the entire apiary such as `Performed OA treatment on all hives`. Do this by clicking the `...` to the right of the apiary in the side bar and choosing add note. This note will display in all hives.
