If you have good WIFI in your apiary, BroodMinder-WiFi should work for you.
We recommend setting this up where there is strong WIFI and a nice work area prior to placing in your apiary.

- We recommend you test everything before you take it to your apiary.

- You will get an email from BroodMinder when we ship the hub. If you don't then check your junk email folder, or contact us. The email has instructions on connecting the hub to your account. There are two cases.

  1. If there is a link in the email, then click it and you will be guided to connect the hub to your account and claim the one year token which is included with purchase.

  2. If there is not a link, then we assigned it to your account before shipping. 

- Remove the cover and pull out the "Remove before use" tabs. The LED should flash for a few seconds.

- Now start up the Bees App on your phone or tablet and choose the `Devices` page. You should see the BroodMinder-WIFI show up on the list.
