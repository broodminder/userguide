# Daily Use

The BroodMinder development team consists of beekeepers and we've been using BroodMinder sensors in our own hives since 2015. Our apiaries range from a couple of hives to over 75, fully instrumented to make our beekeeing more successful and easier to manage. In this section we will describe how we use our devices and software wwith hopes that it give you insights into your own colony management.

Details of setup and configuration is discussed in other sections, however we will start with what sensors we find the most valuable and why.

- BroodMinder Hub - We recommend a BroodMinder-T91 hub. Having data automatically uploaded hourly brings a lot of value to the rest of the system and makes your time in the apiary better. Even more importantly, with the release of new firmware for the devices, a hub will allow you to extend battery life to 5 years for most devices. (See Bees APp - Battery Saver for more information on this.)
- BroodMinder-T2/TH2 - Every hive should have at least one temperature sensor. Temperature is very cost effective and informative. Adding humidity is optional for most folks. It is nice to knowo, but not as informative as temperature. With temperature alone you can watch:
  - Brood Status and strength
  - Swarming
  - Alive during winter
- BroodMinder-W - It is useful to have at least one strong hive outfitted with a scale. While it is great to watch weight on every hive, the cost can be prohibative. By watching at least one hive you can keep track of nectar flows. The information a scale provides is speaking more to the environment around you and can signal when it is a good idea to add supers or harvest honey.
- BroodMinder-BeeDar - The BeeDar is a cool device and you can learn a lot about entrance activity as well as hive sound levels. It is great for letting you know when your colony is out foraging. However, they are still a bit pricy, so we feel this is a nice but optional sensor.

So generally, we recommend a hub, a scale, and multiple T2s all running at a one hour (default) sample rate. We will proceed with the discussion based on that setup.

We'll start with the Bees app. It will be the best tool to use while visiting your apiary. A typical inspection might look like this.

- First bring up the Apiaires tab and check out the Nectar Flow as well as upcoming weather for the apiary. You can also look at the apiary notes from your visit as well as any alerts that you should be aware of.
- Next check out the hives tab. All of your hives are listed across the top along with their current brood estimate and daily weight change. You will also notice a small heart that indicate the overall health estimate for the hive. If there is a note in the upper right corner of the hive info, that is indicating that there are alerts associated with this hive. It may be a low battery or rapid weight loss or any of the alarms that are managed in MyBroodMinder. You will want to check into them.
- Now you might want to first look into hives that are underperforming. Once you select the hive, then you can look at the various values for the last week or two. Weight, productivity, tempearture, humidity,  and brood will give you good insights into what may be going on.
- This is all good information to have at hand as you dive into hive inspection.
