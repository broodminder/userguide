### What are the different BroodMinder apps ?

**You should be using the Bees App!**

Every other App is part of the Broodminder legacy and described below. Those 'other' apps are still in service but not maintained. 

2016-2018 : The BroodMinder app (also called BroodMinder Lite) was the basic free application. With this app, you can visualize your sensors, send your data by e-mail, see different graphs, annotate your inspections, etc. This app is Deprecated.

2018-2022 BroodMinder Apiary was a more powerful app. It makes it possible to download data from all your BroodMinder sensors in a single step. This is an efficient time-saver for users that have many sensors. The app is free but requires a subscription for productivity features. This app is Deprecated.

### Retrieving data from sensors

#### Do the sensors record the measurements?

Each sensor has an internal memory. Every hour they measure data and store it in their memory. The storage capacity is about one year of measurements. We often see sensors with more than 7000 readings! (365*24=8760 readings/year). This memory can be emptied either by removing the battery for a few seconds or from the mobile application. Of course before doing this, make sure that you have synchronized the data with mybroodminder! 

#### How do I recover data with a smartphone? 

You must go to your apiary with a smartphone and the BroodMinder Bees App installed. If you have a free account, the synchronization will be done sensor by sensor. All sensors communicate via Bluetooth. The smartphone's coverage distance is a few meters.

#### How does data recovery from a Hub work?

The Hub provides you with real-time monitoring. You have access to all alerts and can anticipate your work on the apiary before you even get there. The Hub is available in two versions - Wifi & GSM -  depending on your connectivity. This transmitter must be placed in the center of your apiary. It will collect and transmit data automatically, whether you have a single or dozens of sensors within a radius of about 20 meters. 

#### What can I do if I can't synchronize my hives ?

The Bluetooth coverage distance depends on many factors. On some hives, this coverage can be limited. Position yourself as close as possible to the hive and try again following the instructions. If another failure occurs, contact us at support@mellisphera.com. 

### Battery 

#### Is the battery replaceable?

Yes, all batteries are button type CR203 and can be found in any large store.

#### How long does the battery last?

Under normal conditions, the battery lasts more than a year. We recommended you to replace it during the autumn harvest. We will notify you when it is time to replace it.

#### Do BroodMinder sensors last more than a year?

Don't worry as long as the battery is replaced. The sensors will last for many years.

### I'd like to explore Mellisphera but I'm not equipped yet ###

You can use our demo account. You will visualize data from a few hives so you can see the solution functionalities. Browse and edit freely, we reset the account every night!

### When is the data updated?
The hourly data is updated every hour if new data is available. 

Daily data (weather, brood, weight, etc.) is updated twice a day so that every morning in Europe and America the data is available: between 6:30 and 7:30 and between 12:30 and 13:30 UTC.


Computing daily data :

Time <br> UTC | Paris <br> CET | NewYork <br> EDT
--- | --- | ---
6:00 | 7:00 | 1:00
12:00 | 13:00 | 7:00

(*) note that it may apply +1h in summer time.

Finally, we retrieve your missing data and readjust the data from devices and hives that have changed location over the day every night (between 1:00 and 3:00 UTC).


#### Can I share my apiaries with my beekeeper friends?
Yes, you have a few ways to share your data with your family and friends. Go to https://doc.mybroodminder.com/50_mybroodminder_v5/#sharing to find out the best one for your needs.
