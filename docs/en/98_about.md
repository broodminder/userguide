# About this user manual

At BroodMinder we know how important documentation is. Having a structured, updated, comprehensive and easy to search documentation is important for all of us. That's why we're making a great effort to keep it updated in a moving environment where products and features are constantly evolving. 

- In 2023 we made a big leap ahead moving from the pdf document ([legacy manual 2015-2022](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hwmde6h97sbmzl4/BroodMinder-User-Guide.pdf?e=1&dl=0)) to the online 'web-oriented' documentation. This opened a large field of usage opportunites. But we kept strugling with updating documentation in multiple languages..

- In 2024 we are making a new leap by introducing AI and auto translation to every languages! We are excited at the idea to deliver native language documentation to every beekeeper!
