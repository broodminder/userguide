# Introduction to BroodMinder Hubs

All BroodMinder sensors transmit data via Bluetooth. There are several ways to collect the data :

1. Via your smartphone (see the Bees App section of the manual) or via a hub.

2. We use hubs to monitor and send data to the cloud automatically every hour so that you can see your current hive status anywhere there is internet available. You can picture a bicycle wheel where your BroodMinder devices are the spokes and the hub listens to all of them and sends their data to the cloud.
We also have special cases for swarming. It will send a text or email notification within 10 minutes of the event.

We offer serveral technologies for data transmission. Depending on your use case, there might be one that fits better than the others.

- BroodMinder-T91 Naked Cell Hub - Cellular hub must be recharged every 6-14 months
- BroodMinder-T91 Solar Cell Hub - Cellular hub, solar powered, never needs recharging
- BroodMinder-WIFI - WIFI hub for apiaries with good WIFI avaiable
- BroodMinder-LoRa - LoRa hub providing long range coverage solution for specific needs.

- BroodMinder-SubHub - This is a hub with no WIFI or Cellular. It can be used in remote locations to collect all sensor data into one device which makes downloading data to your cell phone very fast. It can also be used to connect remote (50-400 meters) hives to a shared BroodMinder-T91.

All of these hubs are monitored and set up using the BroodMinder Bees App. 

All of the hubs sample the BroodMinder devices every 10 minutes.

We are happy to help you configure your system. The variety of apiary locations and installations is vast and it can be confusing to get everything working correctly. We have made these tools to be flexible and work in most situations, everywhere from downtown New York City to the rural Yukon Territory or the Pyren√©es mountains.
