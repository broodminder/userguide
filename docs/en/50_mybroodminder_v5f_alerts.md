There are almost 30 events from hives, devices, & weather that can trigger an alert. There's different kind of alerts, those that you wanna track over time, those that are just contextual and informative, some notifications to make you aware..

Here is a sample of different alerts

- SwarMinder events
- Hive events
- Weather forectast events
- Nectar flow start/stop
- QueenMinder notifications
- Plants notifications 
- Device events
- etc.


## Configure

In `Configure > Alerts`, youâ€™ll find a list of fully configurable alerts. You can:

- **Adjust alert thresholds** to better match your context
- **Disable any alerts** you donâ€™t want to receive

## Email digest

At the top of the page, you can also enable the **Alert Summary Email** and choose how often you receive it. These emails provide a concise overview of the most recent alerts, like this:

## Bees App

Not all alerts are handled within MyBroodMinder. Some â€” especially more **ephemeral notifications** â€” are managed and delivered directly through the **Bees App**.

These may include:

- Real-time connectivity issues
- Device status updates
- App-specific reminders or observations

These lightweight alerts are designed for immediate attention and are not stored long-term in your MyBroodMinder history.
