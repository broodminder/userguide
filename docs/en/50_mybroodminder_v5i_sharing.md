From MyBroodMinder you have many options to share your hives with other beekeepers and friends:

## With another user
Share an Apiary (in the Apiary `â€¦ > share` ) with another MyBroodMinder user simply enter his/her account email. Acces is granted per apiary, in read only mode. They will see apiary and hives but not devices.

## On beecounted

Share an apiary [beecounted.org](https://www.beecounted.org) (in the Apiary `â€¦ > share`, see above). By default, all free acounts are sharing on beecounted.
