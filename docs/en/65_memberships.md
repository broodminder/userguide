# BroodMinder Memberships

## Why?

For the past eight years, we have worked tirelessly to develop the BroodMinder ecosystem, one of the most innovative systems in the beekeeping world. While some of our team generously volunteer their time, we also have dedicated full-time colleagues who rely on a salary. Keeping the system running and continuously improving requires significant effort, including covering cloud usage and data storage costs. If you have benefited from our service, please consider supporting us by purchasing a membershipâ€”starting at less than $1 per month per hive. Your support allows us to enhance our tools and better serve beekeepers worldwide.


## Tier Memberships

In October 2024 we operated a major shift on our subscription model to basically, make it more simple.
All features, including all hub support, are now included in a single subscription.  

Our goal is to provide clearer, more flexible options for beekeepers of all sizes, with the following subscription tiers based on the number of active hives on your account:

- Tier 0: Up to 5 hives: free membership
- Tier 1: Up to 5 hives: paid membership
- Tier 2: Up to 12 hives: paid membership
- Tier 3: Up to 20 hives: paid membership
- Tier 4: Over 20 hives: paid membership
