# BroodMinder Memberships

## Why?

For the past eight years, we have worked tirelessly to develop the BroodMinder ecosystem, one of the most innovative systems in the beekeeping world. While some of our team generously volunteer their time, we also have dedicated full-time colleagues who rely on a salary. Keeping the system running and continuously improving requires significant effort, including covering cloud usage and data storage costs. If you have benefited from our service, please consider supporting us by purchasing a membership—starting at less than $1 per month per hive. Your support allows us to enhance our tools and better serve beekeepers worldwide.

Thank you for being a valued part of our community. 


## Tier Memberships

In October 2024 we operated a major shift on our subscription model to basically, make it more simple.
All features, including all hub support, are now included in a single subscription.  

Our goal is to provide clearer, more flexible options for beekeepers of all sizes, with the following subscription tiers based on the number of active hives on your account:

- Tier 0: Up to 5 hives: FREE membership
- Tier 1: Up to 5 hives: paid membership
- Tier 2: Up to 12 hives: paid membership
- Tier 3: Up to 20 hives: paid membership
- Tier 4: Over 20 hives: paid membership
 

For more details, please check the [features and plans](https://eu.broodminder.com/pages/plans) as well as the [Membership FAQ](https://eu.broodminder.com/pages/plans-and-membership-faq) in our store.

!!! tip "Good to Know: 30-Day Premium Trial for New Users"

    Make the most of your first month and discover everything your BroodMinder system can do!
    
## Free vs Premium

We offer both a free and a [premium service](https://myBroodMinder.com/app/premium-subscription). We have attempted to establish an equitable and economical system for our wide variety of users. However, if you do not desire the Premium features, it is still possible to read and analyze your BroodMinder devices. 

BroodMinder-Free approach:

- Create a MyBroodMinder account
- You will be allowed a maximum of 5 hives.
- If you have additional sensors they are still supported, but can not be assigned to additional hives.
  - Devices are read and transferred to MyBroodMinder with the Bees app using the "Devices" tab
  - Data/graphs are viewed in MyBroodMinder by clicking on the link in the "Configure | Devices" tab
- You can name devices to reflect their location if you wish
- Note that this approach will also work if you have a paid account to read additional sensors beyond your subscription level.
