# Distributor Information

## Welcome to  BroodMinder

We love our distributors and we are happy to get you set up for success. We are developing sales aids and we appreciate any ideas that you might have along these line. 

## Basics

Once we establish you as a distributor, we will give you a discount code to use in our Shopify web store. You will find that the discounts will apply to most products, but not to the items that we already discount for our customers. Once you enter the discount code, you will see the discount applied.

Any special requests can be entered into the order and Donna will be certain to take care of them. If you need literature or other items, just note it there and she will contact you.

## Discounts Available

Our discounts are based primarily on marketing of the product. Our goal is to spread the word regarding beehive monitoring so featuring BroodMinder on your web presence gets the best discount. Note that the discounts are applied individually. The maximum available is 27%.
